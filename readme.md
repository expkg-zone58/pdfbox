# Pdfbox
A `BaseX` interface for the `Apache Pdfbox library` version 3. 

> The [Apache PDFBoxÂ® library](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) is an open source Java tool for working with PDF documents. This project allows creation of new PDF documents, manipulation of existing documents and the ability to extract content from documents.

This interface is packaged in the [Expath XAR](https://docs.basex.org/main/Repository#expath_packaging) format. The package includes the required Pdfbox jars.
A test suite is available and workflow actions run these tests against BaseX 10.7 and 11.7.

> [!NOTE]  
>Currently (v0.3.6) works with BaseX 9.7, but this may change with future versions.

# Install
Pre-built `pdfbox-x.y.z.zar` files are available on the [releases](../../releases) page. They can be installed using the standard respository functions or using the GUI.

# Usage
```xquery
import module namespace pdfbox="org.expkg_zone58.Pdfbox3";

pdfbox:with-pdf("...path/to/pdf.pdf",
 function($pdf){
  (1 to pdfbox:number-of-pages($pdf))!pdfbox:page-text($pdf,.)
 }
)
```

## Build

* `scripts/make-xar.xq` packages the required `jar`s and `xqm` files to a `xar` file in the `dist` folder.

The `package.json` is (ab)used as a configuration source. Non standard information is held in the `expkg_zone58` section. This is experimental and may change.

`package.json` contains script to run
1. The XAR build.
2. The tests
3. The documentation
### Action support

The workflow `ci-basex.yaml` builds and tests the package. This can be used as an action on [github](https://github.com/features/actions), or on a local [gitea](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/actions/overview) or [forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) installation.
